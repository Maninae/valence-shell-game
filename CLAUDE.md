# Valence

Interactive site teaching how electrons arrange in atoms and why atoms bond,
from first principles. Live target: maninae.github.io/valence.
Sibling to grid-atlas and graph-playground: **vanilla JS, no build step,
GitHub Pages from main root.** Three.js + KaTeX from CDN only.

## Audience and voice

A smart STEM high schooler who has NOT taken chemistry. They know atoms have
protons, neutrons, and electrons — nothing else is assumed. Every concept is
built from first principles in sequence; never name-drop a term (orbital,
shielding, electronegativity) before the site has constructed it.

- Treat the reader as intelligent. Real vocabulary, no babying.
- **Narrative AND lean — comprehension always wins.** Owen calibrated this
  twice: v1 was too padded (cut ~30%), then the cut version was too
  telegraphic ("Obvious model: a solar system" teaches nothing). The spec:
  flowing cause-and-effect prose where every "therefore" has its "because"
  on the page, full sentences with connectors, each concept explained
  before it's used. An average American 9th grader should follow every
  paragraph. What stays banned: throat-clearing, restating what an
  interactive already shows, recap padding, decorative asides. Punchy
  fragments are payoff lines AFTER an explanation, never the explanation.
- KaTeX `\htmlData{tip=...}` values must be plain ASCII with NO commas,
  parentheses, percent signs, or unicode (em-dashes included) — KaTeX
  parses commas as attribute separators and the whole equation dies to
  red raw source. Use " - " to set off clauses.
- **No hook questions** ("Ever wondered why...?") — Owen vetoed these as cheesy.
  Open sections with declarative claims or observations instead.
- Less prose, more seeing and doing. Interactives are the spine; prose is
  connective tissue between them. If a paragraph can become a manipulable
  thing, it should.
- Em-dash discipline: prefer colons, commas, or periods.
- All math symbols in prose must be KaTeX (`$...$`). No KaTeX in h2/h3
  headings (sidebar TOC is auto-generated from heading text) — use HTML
  entities there.

## Architecture

```
index.html                  hub: hero orbital cloud + chapter cards
chapters/01-the-cloud.html  one file per chapter
styles/shared.css           single stylesheet, all tokens + components
scripts/shared.js           TOC, progress bar, KaTeX, tooltips, nav, helpers
scripts/orbital-cloud.js    reusable Three.js hydrogenic point-cloud component
scripts/chXX/*.js           per-chapter interactive modules (ES modules)
data/elements.json          baked element data (see build/bake_data.py)
data/subshell_energies.json Slater orbital-energy curves, Z = 1..40
build/                      Python bake pipeline; rerun to regenerate data/
```

Dependencies flow one direction: `chapter page → chapter modules →
shared modules → data`. Keep each JS module under ~300 lines, one
responsibility each. State lives in a per-interactive controller object;
helpers are stateless functions.

Three.js is loaded via importmap from CDN (see chapter 1). KaTeX via CDN
stylesheet + script (see shared.js `renderMath`, `trust: true` for
`\htmlData` tooltips).

## Design system: "dark lab"

Near-black blue depths; electron clouds and accents glow. All colors are CSS
custom properties in `:root` — never hardcode colors in component rules.

**The subshell color law (most important rule on the site):** each subshell
type has one fixed color used EVERYWHERE — energy-ladder rungs, periodic-table
blocks, orbital clouds, configuration text, chips, chart strokes:

| Subshell | Token | Color |
|----------|-------|-------|
| s | `--s-color` | cyan |
| p | `--p-color` | amber |
| d | `--d-color` | violet |
| f | `--f-color` | green |

Use `.sub-s/.sub-p/.sub-d/.sub-f` utility classes for colored text/chips.
If a visual shows subshells in any form, it must use these colors. This is
pedagogy, not decoration (same principle as graph-playground's knob colors).

**Fonts:** `--display` Space Grotesk (headings), `--sans` Inter (body),
`--mono` JetBrains Mono (labels, eyebrows, tags, code, axis labels).

**Callouts:** `.callout.definition` (blue) / `.model` (violet, for "the
model says" boxes) / `.example` (amber) / `.insight` (green) / `.note`
(muted). Each takes a `.callout-label`.

**Interactive panels:** wrap every interactive in
```html
<div class="interactive">
  <div class="interactive-label">Interactive</div>
  <h4 class="interactive-title">Title of the toy</h4>
  <p class="interactive-hint">One line telling the reader what to try.</p>
  <div class="interactive-stage"> ...canvas/svg... </div>
  <div class="interactive-controls"> ...sliders/buttons... </div>
  <div class="interactive-readout"> ...live values... </div>
</div>
```
Controls: `.control-group` wraps a `.control-label` + input. Sliders are
styled `input[type=range]`. Buttons: `.btn` (default), `.btn.primary` (glow).
Toggle rows: `.seg-toggle` with `.seg-btn` children (`aria-pressed`).

**Canvas/SVG rules (hard requirements):**
- Cap visual width (max ~900px) and center with auto margins. Never stretch
  a visualization to 100% of an uncapped container.
- Labels must never overlap each other or hide behind visual elements.
  Stagger or offset them. Screenshot-verify before calling a page done.
- Size canvases for devicePixelRatio (crisp on retina).
- Dark-canvas palette: backgrounds transparent or `--bg-deep`; strokes from
  tokens; glow via `shadowBlur`/additive blending, used purposefully.

## Page skeleton (chapters)

Copy chapter 1's structure exactly:
sidebar (auto-TOC) → progress bar → header (eyebrow "Chapter N" + title +
description + tags) → top nav → article (roadmap paragraph, then sections)
→ boss panel (end-of-chapter challenge) → bottom nav.

- Section h2s get `<span class="section-number">N.X</span>` prefixes.
- Top nav and bottom nav must have identical prev/next hrefs and titles;
  update neighbors when adding a chapter.
- Every chapter ends with a "boss" challenge (`.boss-panel`): an interactive
  quiz/game applying the chapter, in the spirit of graph-playground's levels.
- Roadmap paragraph (`.lecture-roadmap`): 2-3 sentences previewing the
  journey, not meta-commentary.

## Chapter map (v1)

1. **Where electrons live** — scale of the atom; the planetary model and its
   collapse; standing waves quantize; orbitals as 3D standing waves
   (Three.js viewer); radial probability and penetration. `chapters/01-the-cloud.html`
2. **The filling order** — Pauli, Hund, aufbau via the ladder game; shielding
   and penetration break degeneracy; Slater energy curves crossing (4s/3d);
   why transition metals ionize from 4s; Cr/Cu boss. `chapters/02-filling-order.html`
3. **The table is a map** — building the table from the filling order;
   blocks = subshells; valence electrons explain columns; Zeff drives the
   radius / ionization-energy / electronegativity trends (heatmap layers).
   `chapters/03-the-table.html`
4. **One continuum, not three bonds** — the H2 energy well; shared clouds;
   the electronegativity tug-of-war (covalent → polar → ionic is ONE axis,
   ΔEN); NaCl lattice; placing real bonds on the continuum.
   `chapters/04-one-continuum.html`
5. **Building molecules** — Lewis dot notation from valence counts; octet
   from s+p capacity; the Lewis builder (octet + formal-charge checking);
   double/triple bonds; teases VSEPR + hydrogen bonding (v2).
   `chapters/05-building-molecules.html`

## Data notes

- `elements.json`: `en` is Pauling electronegativity, `ie1` is first
  ionization energy in eV (converted from kJ/mol), `zeff` is Slater
  effective nuclear charge on the outermost s/p electron, `radiusProxy` is
  the Slater-derived size estimate in Å (label it as modeled, not measured).
  `xpos/ypos` are periodic-table grid coordinates (f-block in rows 9-10).
- `subshell_energies.json`: probe energies from Slater's rules. K (Z=19):
  4s = −4.8 eV vs 3d = −1.5 eV; crossing happens by Sc (Z=21): 3d = −13.6 eV
  vs 4s = −8.9 eV. When citing these in prose, note they come from Slater's
  empirical shielding rules (a simplification, but an honest one).

## Checklist: touching any page

1. No KaTeX in headings; section numbers on article h2s.
2. Subshell color law respected in every visual.
3. Both navs updated (and neighbors', if order changed).
4. Canvas centered + capped; labels non-overlapping; retina-scaled.
5. Interactives degrade gracefully (a static fallback message if JS fails).
6. Mobile pass: hamburger TOC, stacked controls, canvas fits 360px width.
7. Screenshot before declaring done.
